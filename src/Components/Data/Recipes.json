Sam Saunders, a Piano major and alumnus of the School of Music, Theatre and Dance, founded Seven Mile Music in direct response to the harsh cuts to music and arts education funding in Detroit Public Schools. Based on a belief that every student should have access to music education, Seven Mile understands that the opportunity to creatively express oneself is essential for all children and has since expanded to teach art, creative writing, and coding."
